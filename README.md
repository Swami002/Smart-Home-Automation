# Smart-Home-Automation
**Technologies:** Arduino UNO, Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN), Bluetooth (HC-05), DHT11, Rain & Flame Sensors, LED Lighting

## Description
An automated smart home system that uses sensors and wireless communication to enhance safety, energy efficiency, and comfort.

## Features
- Integrates **Rain Detection**, **Flame Sensor**, **DHT11 (Temperature & Humidity)**, and **LED lighting** for automated responses.
- Controlled wirelessly using **Bluetooth HC-05 module**.
- Demonstrates a **working WSN prototype** with sensor-based automation.
- Improves **safety** and **user comfort** through real-time monitoring and automation.

## Getting Started
1. Connect the sensors and LEDs to the Arduino UNO as per the schematic.
2. Upload the Arduino sketch to the board.
3. Connect via **Bluetooth** to control and monitor the system.
4. Observe automated actions triggered by environmental sensor inputs.
